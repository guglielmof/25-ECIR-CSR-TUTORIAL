# A LITTLE CHAT GOES A LONG WAY: HANDS-ON TUTORIAL ON CONVERSATIONAL INFORMATION ACCESS

## Guglielmo Faggioli, Nicola Ferro, Simone Merlo

###  Tutorial on Joint Conversational Search and Recommendation at ECIR 2025, 04th April, Lucca, Italy

This repository contains the code used for the ECIR '25 Tutorial on Conversational Search and Recommendation.

Concerning the Conversational Search part, there is a Jupyter notebook and two directories, rewriters and encoders: the former contains the implementation of the rewriters described during the tutorial, while the latter contains the implementation of ConvDR, a dense bi-encoder for implicit  conversational context resolution.

The notebook can also be accessed via the following link: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JcyIOd5RPCRAErFE0Jjg8TC4SP4-2Mu0?usp=sharing">Colab Notebook</a>.

The code reported in the notebook assumes a GPU is available.

The code is available on GitHub for reference; the Python notebook contains instructions for downloading the needed code and data programmatically, hence it can be executed directly.
